#TASKMAP is a simple itinerary creation tool

"Where to next?"

It will help people plan their trips by:
- allowing search of spots
- choosing spots to be included in the trip
- list activities/tasks for each chosen spot
- rate and review each spot and activity
- generating routes from one spot to another
- suggesting interesting spots + activites
    - based on data from 4square and reviews from other users

For development dependencies, run "npm install"

For typescript compilation, typescript@1.5 should be installed, not later or older. Put tsc directory address in tasks.json file. Then run "tsc --init"
